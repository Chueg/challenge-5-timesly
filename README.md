The purpose of this project was to create an interface that could be used to make a schedule for a 9-5 worker that would save when the webpage was closed. Another factor of the schedule is that it would use moment.js to update the background colors of the time blocks whether they are in the past, present, or future hours, as well as including the current date at the top of the page. Here is an example of what the website would look like at 10am with 3 saved events.
